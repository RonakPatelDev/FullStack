Merge: When you merge two branches in Git, you're taking the changes from one branch and combining them with the changes from another branch. The result is a new commit that has the changes from both branches. This creates a merge commit, which shows that the two branches were merged together. When you merge, you're essentially adding the changes from one branch to another, and creating a new point in the commit history where those changes are now combined.

Rebase: When you rebase in Git, you're taking the changes from one branch and putting them on top of the changes in another branch. This means that the commit history is rewritten, so that it looks like the changes from one branch were made after the changes in the other branch. Essentially, you're moving the branch you're currently on to the tip of the other branch, and replaying all your changes on top of it. This creates a linear history, with no merge commits.
